# Css to the rescue

## Overview
In this subject I am tasked to explore the possibilities of css by making a certain assignment.

### Assignments
1. Modulaire Control panel
2. Interactive firework show
3. 3D Rubriks cube :goat:
4. Tailwind without Tailwind

### Decision
I ended up choosing for the modulaire control panel because I saw the most potential in that one and I wanted to know how you can handle different kinds of interactions with css only.

### Criteria
* No use of Javascript only html and css
* No ids and classes
* Keep grinding big dawg

## Week 1 :thinking:
This week I was looking at what I was gonna create. I looked at different control panels that I thought were nice to make.

### Ideas & Concept
| Death star      |
| :---        |  
| ![Death star](images/deathstar.jpeg)  |

First idea that popped up in my head was to create the death star control panel from the Star wars franchise. I thought it would be a really cool concept to make but my css abilities limited me from actually making this so I ended up not going for it.

| Spaceship control panel      |
| :---        |  
| ![Space ship](images/starwars.jpg)  |
My second idea was to make the inside of a space ship. I definitely thought that this is something what I could do but I had a hard time what I wanted to make for the interaction.

| Pip boy fallout      |
| :---        |  
| ![Space ship](images/pipboy.jpg)  |

My final idea and the idea I settled for was to create pip boy from the fallout series. This concept looked the most fun to me and also do-able. The next step was to figure how I would create this concept in css.

### Gameplan
| Pipboy lofi layout | Pipboy final
| :---: | :--:
| ![Pip boy](images/pipboy2d.jpeg)| ![Pip boy](images/pipboyfinal.png)|
After looking around on the internet I found images that showcased the pipboy control panel in a 2d format.

### Interaction
The interaction would be the startup animation of the pip boy. The power button in the final design would be the trigger for the animation. The youtube link below showcases how the animation would work. Skip to **2:35** to see it.

### Challenges :sob:
Creating the general shape of the control panel wont be much of a problem. Challenge might occur in how I will make the typing animation and how I would trigger it without Javascript

* Creating a typing animation
* Trigger the animation when the power button turns on
* Make the different details on the control panel (might take some time)
